# MY READS PROJECT

## Project Overview and Purpose

This project is about a books store app built for the Udacity React Nanodegree program. It is basically a books store with three shelves namely, Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read. A user can move a book from one shelf to another, and also search for a new book and add to any of the shelves. The purpose is to demonstrate understanding of the basic structure and operation of a React app.

### How to Load and Run the App

The project was completed using the Create-React-App starter code by udacity as a base, and it uses Node.js. To run this app, you will need Node installed. You can download the latest stable version of Node from: (https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once Node is successfully installed, git clone the project repo: (https://github.com/Raphael9830/myreads-app-reactnd-project.git)


** Run npm install to install all dependencies

Once all dependencies are installed, run 
** npm start start the development server

Once this is done, a new browser window should open showing the app. You can manually open the app in your browser with the url [http://localhost:3000/]

#### How to Use the App

- On the app's main page, books are sorted into three different shelves - Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read.
- You can change a book's shelf or remove it completely by choosing one of the select options using the green dropdown button on the book's cover.

To add new books, 
- click on the big green + button at the botton of the bottom right of the page. This opens a search page
- Enter a book title or author's name in the search field. This returns up to 20 items.
